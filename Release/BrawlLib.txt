This fork of BrawlLib is based on BrawlLib v0.18 from:
http://forums.kc-mm.com/index.php?topic=17547.0

It will remain backwards compatible with BrawlBox v0.71,
while also adding additional properties/methods needed
for my own software.

|************ Change Log ************|
 ====================================

 (4/6/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L3 (libertyernie)
    . Two versions of MD5 checksum now available in ResourceNode
	  . MD5() or MD5Str(): gets the MD5 checksum of OriginalSource (or null if there is none)
	  . MD5EnsureChildrenIncluded() or MD5StrEnsureChildrenIncluded(): will XOR own MD5 sum with those of children if children aren't already included in the node's own data
    . Note: result of MD5() is NOT guaranteed to match the MD5 checksum of a node's data after being exported to a separate file

 (3/13/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L2 (libertyernie)
	. When exporting BRES entries (TEX0, MDL0, etc.), reset the BRES index offset (0x0c, 4 bytes) to 0 so that exported files with the same data will be identical
	. Implement MD5() and MD5Str() functions to get checksums of resource node data
	. Override MD5() for BRESEntryNode to simulate the export behavior, so checksums of identical nodes will match

 (2/13/2014) - BrawlLib v0.18L (libertyernie)
	. Added the HideMDL0Errors assembly property, which will prevent dialog boxes from appearing when MDL0 errors are detected
	. Added the InitialSize and InitialFormat properties to TextureConverterDialog
	. Added Volume and VolumePercent properties to AudioPlaybackPanel
