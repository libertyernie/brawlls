=======

Recursive listing of SSBB data file contents from the command line. (C++/CLI)

This repository also contains a C++ program named values32b that compiles with Visual Studio as well as g++. The code in values32b.cpp is also included in brawlls - primarily to describe STDT data, which is not supported directly by BrawlLib but occasionally used to modify stage files.
